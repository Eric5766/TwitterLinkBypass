Grease/Tampermonkey script to, where possible, bypass t.co links on click by taking the actual url from the link tag (The on-hover popup that shows the true url).  Does not work with links like Youtube videos where the destination URL is not stored anywhere client side.

Useful if you use tracking link blockers (Like included with Pihole) that block the redirects.
